This plugin provides single sign-on via SAML and gives users one-click access to their WordPress accounts from identity providers like OneLogin.

This SAML plugin eliminates passwords and allows you to authenticate WordPress users (typically editors) against your existing Active Directory or LDAP server as well increase security using YubiKeys or VeriSign VIP Access via OneLogin. OneLogin is pre-integrated with thousands of apps and handles all of your SSO needs in the cloud and behind the firewall.

* Eliminate passwords in WordPress
* Allow users to sign into WordPress with their *Active Directory* or *LDAP* credentials

* Increase security using two-factor authentication from *Yubico* or *VeriSign* or browser PKI certificates
* Easily share logins
* Easily prevent access from former employees and contractors

== Installation ==

In order to use this plugin, you will need a SAML identity provider. You can sign up for OneLogin's service at www.onelogin.com. Detailed configuration instructions can be found in OneLogin's support forums.

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.
